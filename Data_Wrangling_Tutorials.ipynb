        "Missing data is a common challenge in ecological and forestry datasets due to field limitations, measurement errors, or data entry issues. Identifying and appropriately handling missing values is essential to maintain the integrity and reliability of the analysis. Effective strategies such as imputation, exclusion, or flagging missing entries help ensure that the dataset remains robust and that subsequent analyses or models are not biased or compromised by incomplete information. Addressing missing data transparently also supports reproducibility and scientific rigor in forestry research."
