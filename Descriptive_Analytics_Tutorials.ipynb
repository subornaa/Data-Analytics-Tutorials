If the outliers represent genuine observations and are relevant to the problem at hand, it may be appropriate to include them, possibly with robust modeling techniques that can handle their influence (which will be covered in later chapters.).***It is important to avoid discarding data without a valid justification. Any reduction or pruning of the dataset should be supported by clear, logical reasoning.*** For example, if outliers result from data entry errors or are not representative of the population you're studying, excluding them could be justified.

        "In summary, covariance and correlation both measure the tendency of two variables to move together, that is, how closely related they are. This is especially important in machine learning, where identifying and selecting highly correlated features (and removing less significant ones) can improve model accuracy and help reduce overfitting. These topics we will explore further later on.\n",
        "\n",
        "Correlation is calculated in a way that makes it scale-invariant, meaning it is unaffected by the units of the variables. This makes it particularly useful for understanding the strength and direction of a relationship between features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Covariance, on the other hand, reflects the direction of the linear relationship but not its strength, and it is sensitive to scale. While both metrics provide insight into relationships between variables, correlation is generally more useful for feature selection."
