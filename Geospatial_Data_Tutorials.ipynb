        "## File Formats\n",
        "\n",
        "Different spatial data types have different file formats. This is due to the way each data type is organized. Raster data is stored as a grid (array) format, and can be stored efficiently in formats such as GeoTIFF (.tif). In contrast, vector data is continuous and more complex, meaning it requires different file formats such as shapefile (.shp) or GeoPackage (.gpkg). Finally, LiDAR data is the most dense data format, with point clouds often containing millions of points, each with XYZ coordinates and additional attributes. Point cloud data derived from LiDAR sensors  is typically stored in .las or .laz formats.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Packages\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the different file formats and data characteristics, each spatial data type has its own corresponding packages used for reading, writting, and processing in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "While there are many packages available for each data type, we will use the following three in this tutorial:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Raster: [rioxarray](https://corteva.github.io/rioxarray/stable/index.html)**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Vector: [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/)**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Point Cloud: [laspy](https://laspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**\n",
        "\n",
        "## Visualization\n",
        "\n",
        "**A great place to begin when working with any spatial data is visualization**\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: in some cases the dataset may be too massive to visualize quickly/easily. In such cases, the data may need to be subset prior to visualizing."
